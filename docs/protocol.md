# parsing a protocol file from xyz

## Overview of the format '\*.p'

The .p files are a definition of timing for when to measure, and what to label the data as for later calcualtion of paramters. The protocols are a simple text file with the '.p' suffix. Lines that start with a semicolon are commented out and ignored by the Fluorcam protocol parser.

The protocol file is divided into a few main sections. The first section is a header, where common parameters are defined. The second section is a definition of functions, or "Actions", that are later utilized in the third section. The third section is a list of commands that are executed in order. This includes turning on and off the actinic lights, taking measurements, and assigning labels to the image data. Commands follow a particular syntax, combining a time and an Action. This syntax is described in the command section below.

## Definitions of parameters

The first section of a protocol file is the definition of parameters. Parameters are defined using the following syntax:

```{protocol}
TS=20ms
;protocol body - generated by wizard
;version ZB February 11, 2010
include default.inc  ;Includes standard options, do not remove it !
include light.inc    ;Includes standard options, do not remove it !
Shutter=3
Sensitivity=52
Act1=100
Super=100
```

Super is the light intensity during the saturation pulse, which utilizes both red and blue actinic banks (Act1 and Act2, respectively). Full intensity is 100, and equates to around 400 uE.

THe include statements are required by the instrument, and should be included in any new protocol file.

TS=20ms defines the time step for the protocol. This is the smallest time increment that the instrument can use. The instrument will accept any number here, but using a different number may lead to undefined behavior.

Definitions can also be called in the body of the protocol file, and behave exactly the same way. The header definitions are placed at the top as a matter of convenience and readability, rather than necessity.

## Action Definitions

The second section of a protocol file is the definition of actions. Actions are defined using the following syntax:

```{protocol}
Action SATPULSE begin
  <-mfmsub_length>=>mfmsub ;before pulse
  <0s>=>SatPulse(800ms)
  <TS,TS + 2 * mfmsub_length .. 800ms/2 - mfmsub_length>=>mfmsub
  <800ms/2,800ms/2 + mfmsub_length .. 800ms>=>mfmsub
  <800ms + mfmsub_length>=>mfmsub
end
;
```

Note that each Action will being with the word Action, following by the name of the action. It is convention to write user-defined Action names in all caps. Fluorcam provided Actions are in lower case, such as act1() and The action will then be followed by the word begin followed by a new line. The action will end with the word end on a new line.

In between begin and end, there is a list of commands and definitions. Each command is on a new line. These commands are executed in order, and are written in the format of `<time>=>command.` The time is the time at which the command is executed. The command is the action to be executed. Many of the normal commands are just calls to mfmsub, which is a macro meaning "measure, flash, measure, then substract".

## Time Syntax

There are two main types of time syntax. The first is a simple time, given in seconds or milliseconds. It executes the given Action at a time in reference to either the beginning of the Action in which it is written, or in reference to the beginning of protocol execution by the program.

The second time syntax is<800ms/2,800ms/2 + mfmsub_length .. 800ms>=>mfmsub<800ms/2,800ms/2 + mfmsub_length .. 800ms>=>mfmsub
The time portion of these Actions does not follow the normal format. It is not a single timepoint. Instead, it defines a sequence of timepoints. The sequence definitions is written as `<start, step .. end>`. This defines a sequence of timepoints from start to end, with a step size of step. All time information is in reference to the moment the Action is called, not the outside time. For example, if the Action is called at 10s, and the sequence is `<0s, 1s .. 10s>`, then the sequence will be 10s, 11s, 12s, 13s, 14s, 15s, 16s, 17s, 18s, 19s, 20s.

The following is an example of a sequence definition:

```{protocol}
    <800ms/2,800ms/2 + mfmsub_length .. 800ms>=>mfmsub
```

In this example, the sequence starts at 800ms/2, and ends at 800ms. The step size is 800ms/2 + mfmsub_length. This means that the mfmsub Action will be executed at the following timepoints: 800ms/2, 800ms/2 + 800ms/2 + mfmsub_length, 800ms/2 + 2 \* (800ms/2 + mfmsub_length), and so on until the end of the sequence is reached.

## Action calls

Calling an Action is done by providing the Action name, with optional parentheses and arguments to provide to the action. If the Action name was defined with arguments, it must be called with arugments provided. `SATPULSE` is acceptable usage, but `SATPULSE(100ms)` is not, as it was not defined with arguments.

## Command Syntax

Commands are written in the format of `<time>=>Action`. Time is a number followed by a unit of time, with no space in between. The units used are `ms` and `s`, referring to milliseconds and seconds. The time field can contain mathematical operations, such as `<PulseStart + PulseDuration - 3*mfmsub_length>`. This example would execute the Action three \* mfmsub_lengths before the end of the pulse. You must be careful not to allow Action executions to overlap inadvertently. The instrument will not allow this, and will throw an error if it occurs.

## Pre-defined Actions

A few of the common pre-defined Actions are listed below. You will see these in existing protocols, and they are useful to know.

```{protocol}
<time>=>mfmsub  ## a call to perform a measurement at the <time> specified
<time>=>act1(PulseDuration) ## a call to turn on the actinic light 1 for <PulseDuration> at <time>
<time>=>checkPoint,"<label>" ## a call to label the data at <time> with <label>, ex "startFm_D3".
```
